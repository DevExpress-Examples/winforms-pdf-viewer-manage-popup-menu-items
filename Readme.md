# PDF Viewer for WinForms - Customize the Pop-Up Menu

The [WinForms PDF Viewer](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/controls/winforms/pdf-viewer/) has several types of popup menus the user can invoke for bookmark options, bookmark tree, page content,Â a thumbnail, and thumbnail options. 

This example shows how to add a new item, hide the popup menu for the bookmark tree, and remove specificÂ items from the page content popup menu.

## Implementation Details

To customize items of the PDF Viewer's popup menu, handle the [PdfViewer.PopupMenuShowing](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPdfViewer.PdfViewer.PopupMenuShowing) event. This event fires every time a user opens a popup menu in the PDF Viewer.Â 

Each popup menuÂ typeÂ has a unique set of bar items that are located in the bar item link collection.Â To access aÂ barÂ item link collection, check the [PdfPopupMenuShowingEventArgs.PopupMenuKind](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPdfViewer.PdfPopupMenuShowingEventArgs.PopupMenuKind) property value to determine the menu type and useÂ the [PdfPopupMenuShowingEventArgs.ItemLinks](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPdfViewer.PdfPopupMenuShowingEventArgs.ItemLinks) property.

To hide a popup menu, clear all items from the bar item link collection. To remove an item from the popup menu, find the item by its command ID and then remove it.
